# MIT DeepTraffic Competition (mitselfdrivingcars1.1)

My javascript code that I submitted for MIT's 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars competition (DeepTraffic). I have uploaded two sets of code, one is pre-trained and one is after training.


## Results

I was able to achieve a result of 75mph (average result was +- 0.3mph) after training my AI for around 18 to 20 hours and
with little more tweaking I got an average speed of 75.45mph.

I was also ranked 5th in the leaderboard from 2/2/2017 to 25/2/2017.
